# Mitophagy_project

This project was performed from the gene expression of GTEx database in order to find where the markers of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy are the most expressed in human. 
Using quantitative analysis we obtained that these markers are more represented in skeletal muscle. This result are supported by the results obtained in mice model.

Additionnaly we wanted to know how these markers are expressed in brain subgrouped to justify negative result in mice model.
