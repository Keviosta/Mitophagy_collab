# Mitophagy_project

This project was performed on GTEx database in order to find where the markers of PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy are the most expressed in human? 
Using quantitative analysis we obtained that these markers are more represented in skeletal muscle. This result are supported by the results obtained in mice model.

Paper will be send to a journal end of September 2023.
